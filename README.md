# üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è TifCo Dashboard

This is a dashboard project I built to learn more about NextJS, Tailwind, React, and Vercel. It's pretty basic but fun to put together.

Its a react frontend with next and tailwind for styling. Deployed on Vercel and using their postgres for storage. It has auth, is fully responsive, and is a great base for me to add more interesting features.
